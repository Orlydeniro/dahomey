2. Technology Stack

You'll need a few key technologies:

Frontend (Client-side):

HTML: For structuring the content

CSS: For styling and visual appearance (consider frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS)

JavaScript: For interactivity and handling quiz logic

Framework/Library (Optional): React, Vue.js, or Angular can make it easier to build complex frontends.

Backend (Server-side) (Optional, but recommended for complex apps):

Python (with Flask or Django), Node.js (with Express.js), PHP, or Ruby on Rails: For handling data storage and quiz logic

Database (Optional): If you're storing a lot of content or user information:

SQL Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL (suitable for structured data)

NoSQL Database: MongoDB (flexible for document-based data)

3. Development Steps

Here's a suggested roadmap:

Set up your development environment: Install the necessary tools (Node.js, Python, etc.).

Create the initial HTML structure: Set up your basic pages (landing, history, towns, quiz).

Add CSS for styling: Make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

Implement the quiz functionality:

Write JavaScript to handle question display, answer submission, and scoring.

Store your quiz questions in a suitable format (JSON, in the database).

(If using a backend) Set up the server-side logic:

Create API endpoints for fetching questions, saving user scores, etc.

Connect the backend to a database if needed.

Test thoroughly: Ensure everything works correctly on different devices and browsers.

Deploy your application: Choose a suitable hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, AWS, etc.).
